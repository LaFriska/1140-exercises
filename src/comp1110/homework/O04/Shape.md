Within the `comp1110.homework.O04` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create an abstract class, `Shape`, that stores information about simple shapes.

* `Shape` should have two abstract public methods, `double perimeter()`,
  and `double area()`, which return the length of the perimeter and the
  area of the shape respectively. Both of these methods are abstract.
* Create two additional classes, `Square` and `Circle`, each of which
  extends `Shape`, and each of which takes a single `double` length
  argument in its constructor, which describes the radius (in the case
  of a circle) or side-length (in the case of a square).
* Add a main method to `Shape` which includes the following code:

```
Shape s1 = new Square(10);    // a square with sides of 10.0 units
Shape s2 = new Circle(1.0);   // a circle of radius 1.0 units
System.out.println(s1.perimeter());
System.out.println(s1.area());
System.out.println(s2.perimeter());
System.out.println(s2.area());
```

This should produce the following output:

```
40.0
100.0
6.283185307179586
3.141592653589793
```

Add the ability of store the xy-position of the center of each shape:

* Add `x` and `y` fields to `Shape`.
* For each shape add a second constructor that takes three `double`s as
  arguments, `length`, `x`, and `y`.
* Add an abstract public method `boolean overlaps(Shape other)` to `Shape`
  that takes a single `Shape` as an argument and returns `true` if the other
  shape overlaps the shape it is called on. Assume the squares are upright
  (parallel to the axes).

Consider how you implemented the `overlaps` method: If you add another
subclass of `Shape` (say, a hexagon), would you need to change the
implementation of the `overlaps` method in `Circle` and/or `Square`?
Is there a way to avoid this?

Once you have it working, add, commit and push your work.
