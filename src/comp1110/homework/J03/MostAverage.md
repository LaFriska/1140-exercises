Within the `comp1110.homework.J03` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `MostAverage`. In this class, write a function

```
static int mostAverage(int[] numbers)
```

that takes a array of integers as input and returns the number in the
array that is closest to the average of all numbers in the array. By
"closest", we mean having the smallest absolute difference to the
average. You can assume the array is non-empty, since otherwise the
average is not well defined.

The function should _not_ modify the argument array!

Remember that the average is not necessarily an integer (it may be a
decimal number), but the function should return one of the integers
in the array.

Test your solution using the `J03` test.

Once you have it working, commit and push your work.
