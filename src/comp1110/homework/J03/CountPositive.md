Within the `comp1110.homework.J03` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `CountPositive`. In this class, write a function

```
static int countPositive(int[] numbers)
```

that takes a array of integers as input and returns the number of positive
integers in the array.

The function should _not_ modify the argument array!

Test your solution using the `J03` test.

Once you have it working, commit and push your work.
