Within the `comp1110.homework.J03` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `AllDifferent`. In this class, write a function

```
static boolean allDifferent(int[] numbers)
```

that takes a array of integers as input and returns the boolean value
`true` if all numbers in the array are different; that is, there are
no two numbers in the array that are the same.

The function should _not_ modify the argument array!

Test your solution using the `J03` test.

Once you have it working, commit and push your work.
