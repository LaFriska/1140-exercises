Within the `comp1110.homework.J01` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class a called `HelloWorld` (you should add the file to git when
prompted).

This should appear as a file `HelloWorld` within a package
`comp1110.homework.J01`.

This detail is important because the tests assume that your work appears in
exactly this location.

* Open your `HelloWorld` class, and modify it so that its main
  method prints `Hello world!` (just like it was done in the lectures,
  and in lab 1).
* Test your `HelloWorld` class by selecting the `J01` option in the
  drop-down next to green arrow.
* Once your `HelloWorld` class passes the tests, commit and push it to
  your homework repo.
