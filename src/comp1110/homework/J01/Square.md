Within the `comp1110.homework.J01` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Square`, and write in it a function (static method) with
the signature

`static int square(int side)`

The parameter `side` is an integer that represents the length of a side,
and the function should calculate and return the area of the corresponding
square. Test your solution using the `J01` test.

You can also add a `main` method, and use it to run your own tests of the
function.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
