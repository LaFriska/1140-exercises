Within the `comp1110.homework.J05` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Odd`, and write in it a function

`static boolean isOdd(int i)`

that takes as argument an integer and returns `true` if the argument
is an odd number.

Test your solution using the `J05` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
