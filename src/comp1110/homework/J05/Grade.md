Within the `comp1110.homework.J05` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Grade`, and write in it a function

`static void printGrade(int mark)`

that takes as argument the course mark for a subject (an integer) and
prints the grade based on this mark. Final grades are calculated as
follows: marks between 0 and 49 (inclusive), will be given a grade of
`N`, marks between 50 and 59 grade `P`, 60 and 69 grade `C`, 70 and 79
grade `D`, and finally marks between 80 and 100 (inclusive) are given
the grade `HD`.
If the mark is less than zero or greater than 100, print `Bad mark`.
Test your solution using the `J05` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
