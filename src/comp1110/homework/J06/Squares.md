A positive integer _n_ is a _square_ if there exists an integer _i_ such
that _n_ = _i_ * _i_.

Within the `comp1110.homework.J06` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Squares`. In this class, write a function

```
static void allSquares(int to)
```

that prints out all numbers between 1 and `to` (inclusive) that are squares,
one per line. For example, if `to` is 10, the function should print

```
1
4
9
```

Test your solution using the `J06` test.

Once you have it working, commit and push your work.
